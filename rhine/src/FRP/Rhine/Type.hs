A 'Rhine' consists of a 'SN' together with a clock of matching type 'cl'.
It is a reactive program, possibly with open inputs and outputs.
If the input and output types 'a' and 'b' are both '()',
that is, the 'Rhine' is "closed",
then it is a standalone reactive program
that can be run with the function 'flow'.
