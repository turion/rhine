This module reexports most common names and combinators you will need to work with Rhine.
It does not export specific clocks, resampling buffers or schedules,
so you will have to import those yourself, e.g. like this:

@
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
import FRP.Rhine
import FRP.Rhine.Clock.Realtime.Millisecond

main :: IO ()
main = flow $ constMCl (putStrLn "Hello World!") @@ (waitClock :: Millisecond 100)
