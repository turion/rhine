# Revision history for rhine

## Upcoming

* Removed `SN` GADT in favour of semantic functions, for a > 100x speedup in some benchmarks
  (https://github.com/turion/rhine/pull/348)

## 1.5

* Added `forever` utility for recursion in `ClSFExcept`
* Support GHC 9.10

## 1.4

* Add `Profunctor` instance for `ResamplingBuffer`
* Fix imports of `FRP.Rhine` prelude
* Add `UTCClock` and `WaitUTCClock`, corresponding refactorings
* Remove unreliable `downsampleMillisecond` `ResamplingBuffer`

## 1.3

* Dropped `dunai` dependency in favour of state automata.
  See [the versions readme](./versions.md) for details.
* Moved the monad argument `m` in `ClSFExcept`:
  It is now `ClSFExcept cl a b m e` instead of `ClSFExcept m cl a b e`.
  The advantage is that now the type is an instance of `MonadTrans` and `MFunctor`.
  Analogous changes have been made to `BehaviourFExcept`.
* Support GHC 9.6 and 9.8

## 1.2.1

* Added `FRP.Rhine.Clock.Realtime.Never` (clock that never ticks)
* Changed Busy clock effect to `MonadIO`

## 1.2

## 0.8.1.1

  Thank you, Miguel Negr√£o and Jun Matsushita!

## 0.7.0

* Replaced old reactimation mechanism by clock erasure
* Dropped GHC support for < 8.4
* Reworked `gloss` backends.
  There are now two pure backends and an `IO` backend.
* Relaxed all upper version bounds

## 0.6.0

* Synced with `dunai` version numbers
* Supported GHC 8.8.3

## 0.5.1.0

* Synced with `dunai` version numbers
* Supported GHC 8.6

## 0.5.0.0

* Deprecated GHC 7.*
* Big module reorganisation:
  * Renamed `SyncSF` to `ClSF` and many other renames
    (https://github.com/turion/rhine/issues/45)
  * `FRP.Rhine` by default exports all components
    (signal functions, clocks, schedules, resampling buffers)
* Refactored some fixed step clocks
* Added interpolation buffers

Note that this is the first release that is not in sync
with `dunai`'s version numbers.
`rhine-0.5` depends on `dunai-0.4`.
