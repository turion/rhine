{- | * Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release hull

This module demonstrates the use of timers and exceptions
to create a simple Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) hull signal,
as commonly used in audio processing.
(See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer#Attack_Decay_Sustain_Release_(ADSR)_envelope.)

They can be used to create a wide range of electronic musical instruments,
by combining them with a wave generator (e.g. sine, sawtooth or square).
The ADSR hull is multiplied with the wave signal
to create a tone that first rises in loudness ("attack"),
reaches a peak and becomes quieter again ("decay"),
then stays at that level for a while ("sustain")
until it drops back to zero ("release").

The interpolation happens linearly.
The attack period starts as soon as the user presses a key.
The sustain level, as well as the time spans
for attack, decay and release can be preset,
while the time span for the sustain period ends
when the user stops pressing the key.

-- * The definition of an ADSR

-- | Collects the parameters an ADSR hull depends on.
--   An ADSR is specified by three time spans, and a number between 0 and 1.
data ADSR time s = ADSR
  { a :: Diff time -- ^ The attack time (for how long the level increases)
  , d :: Diff time -- ^ The decay time (for how long the level decreases)
  , s :: s         -- ^ The sustain level (a 'Fractional' between 0 and 1)
  , r :: Diff time -- ^ The release time (how long the level needs to decay)
  }

-- | Some sample settings for an 'ADSR'.
myADSR :: ADSR UTCTime Double
myADSR = ADSR
  { a = 0.05
  , d = 0.2
  , s = 0.3
  , r = 0.2
  }


{- |
Runs a given 'ADSR' parameter set as a 'BehaviourF',
i.e. a /signal/ which can be sampled on an arbitrary clock,
and depends on another input signal.
The output is a 'Fractional' number representing the current envelope amplitude.
The input is a 'Bool' representing the current state of the key.
('True' represents "pressed", 'False' represents "not pressed")

The amplitude of the ADSR goes through five states,
as follows:

* The ADSR hull curve is constantly at 0,
  until the input (representing a key) becomes 'True'.
* The amplitude then increases linearly,
  until it has reached the level 1 after time 'a',
  or the input becomes 'False'.
* If the amplitude reached 1, it then decreases linearly,
  until it has reached the level 's' after time 'd',
  or the input becomes 'False'.
* If the amplitude reached 's', it then sustains it
  until the input finally becomes 'False'.
* When the input becomes 'False', the amplitude decreases to 0 within time 'r'.
  The system then returns to the initial zero amplitude state.
