{- | Effectful streams in coalgebraic encoding.

A stream consists of an internal state @s@, and a step function.
This step can make use of an effect in @m@ (which is often a monad),
alter the state, and return a result value.
Its semantics is continuously outputting values of type @b@,
while performing side effects in @m@.

A coalgebraic encoding was chosen instead of the direct recursion known from e.g. @list-transformer@, @dunai@, @machines@, @streaming@, ...,
because the coalgebraic encoding is much more amenable to compiler optimizations
than the coalgebraic encoding, which is:

@
  data StreamRecursiveT m b = StreamRecursiveT (m (b, StreamRecursiveT m b))
@

When two streams are composed, GHC can often optimize the combined step function,
resulting in a faster streams than what the coalgebraic encoding can ever achieve,
because the coalgebraic encoding has to step through every continuation.
Put differently, the compiler can perform static analysis on the state types of initially encoded state machines,
while the coalgebraic encoding knows its state only at runtime.

This performance gain comes at a peculiar cost:
Recursive definitions /of/ streams are not possible, e.g. an equation like:
@
  fixA stream = stream <*> fixA stream
@
This is impossible since the stream under definition itself appears in the definition body,
and thus the internal /state type/ would be recursively defined, which GHC doesn't allow:
Type level recursion is not supported in existential types.
An stream defined thusly will typically hang and/or leak memory, trying to build up an infinite type at runtime.

It is nevertheless possible to define streams recursively, but one needs to first identify the recursive definition of its /state type/.
Then for the greatest generality, 'fixStream' and 'fixStream'' can be used, and some special cases are covered by functions
such as 'fixA', 'Data.Automaton.parallely', 'many' and 'some'.

-- ** Fix points, or recursive definitions

{- | Recursively define a stream from a recursive definition of the state, and of the step function.

If you want to define a stream recursively, this is not possible directly.
For example, consider this definition:
@
loops :: Monad m => StreamT m [Int]
loops = (:) <$> unfold_ 0 (+ 1) <*> loops
@
The defined value @loops@ contains itself in its definition.
This means that the internal state type of @loops@ must itself be recursively defined.
But GHC cannot do this automatically, because type level and value level are separate.
Instead, we need to spell out the type level recursion explicitly with a type constructor,
over which we will take the fixpoint.

In this example, we can figure out from the definitions that:
1. @'unfold_' 0 (+ 1)@ has @0 :: Int@ as state
2. '(:)' does not change the state
3. '<*>' takes the product of both states

So the internal state @s@ of @loops@ must satisfy the equation @s = (Int, s)@.
If the recursion is written as above, it tries to compute the infinite tuple @(Int, (Int, (Int, ...)))@, which hangs.
Instead, we need to define a type operator over which we take the fixpoint:

@
-- You need to write this:
data Loops x = Loops Int x

-- The library supplies:
data Fix f = Fix f (Fix f)
type LoopsState = Fix Loops
@

We can then use 'fixStream' to define the recursive definition of @loops@.
For this, we have to to tediously inline the definitions of 'unfold_', '(:)', and '<*>',
until we arrive at an explicit recursive definition of the state and the step function of @loops@, separately.
These are the two arguments of 'fixStream'.

loops :: Monad m => StreamT m [Int]
