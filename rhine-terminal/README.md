# README

This package will provide a simple wrapper for the `terminal` library,
enabling you to write `terminal` applications as signal functions.
For now it's an example "repl" program, which you can run as `cabal run rhine-terminal-repl`
or `nix build .#rhine-terminal && result/bin/rhine-terminal-repl`,
